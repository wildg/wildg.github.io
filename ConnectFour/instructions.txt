To run my program, one needs to have the latest express framework, as well as the appropriate socket.io extensions.
Then, one needs to create a run configuration for "index.js", which will serve the main HTML page "index.html" on server
3000, which can be found at:

http://localhost:3000

On one's browser of choice. I used Chrome to complete this assignment and referenced documentation and examples from:

https://socket.io/

All functionality should be working, (Cookies, Color Themes, Usernames, Game Play, Game Creation, and Multiple User
Support). I should mention that if the same user trying to open up multiple pages of the game, only their latest page is
the only one that's able to access the server. Finally, I wrote my code using Webstorm and it runs in that environment.
I'm not sure if it will run in another environment as I tried running it through Visual Studio Code and a native
terminal and I was unable to. I truly hope this is not a problem.

Thank you!
